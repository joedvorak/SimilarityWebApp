# Similarity Web App
This web app is based on Streamlit. It creates a simple web page for exploring the similarities between presentations. It has been designed to help visualize presentation similarities for the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers Annual Internation Meeting.

It currently contains data from AIM 2024.

Use of this app requires creation of a dataframe of the presentations. It needs to include the Presenter's First and Last Names, the Title and the Abstract. Another dataframe holds the similarity matrix for the presentations. It should have the same indices for each presentation should be the same between the dataframes. The similarity dataframe has identical columns and index values.
